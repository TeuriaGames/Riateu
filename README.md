# Riateu
A simple Game Engine made with [Moonworks](https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks).

This is an alternative counterpart of my previous engine: [Teuria](https://github.com/Terria-K/Teuria).
This engine is much more low level and cut some of the Teuria stuffs.

It is still heavily inspired from [Monocle](https://github.com/JamesMcMahon/monocle-engine)
but with a lot more changes for performance and ease of use.

## Supported Platforms:
+ [x] Windows
+ [x] Linux
